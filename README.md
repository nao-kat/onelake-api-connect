# OneLake Python SDK Examples

This repository provides simple and practical Python scripts to interact with **Microsoft Fabric's OneLake** using the official Python SDK.  
It covers the full workflow: creating a sample CSV file, uploading it to OneLake, retrieving file size, and previewing file content.

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Azure CLI login (`az login`)
- Proper Azure AD access permissions
- Access to a OneLake-enabled workspace
- Required Python packages:

```bash
pip install azure-identity azure-storage-file-datalake
```

## üìÅ Scripts Overview

### 1. `generate_csv_sample.py` ‚Äì Generate a Sample CSV File

Creates a mock taxi dataset and saves it locally as a CSV file.

```bash
python generate_csv_sample.py
```

Output: `sample.csv`

---

### 2. `upload_to_onelake.py` ‚Äì Upload CSV File to OneLake

Uploads the generated CSV file to a specified location in OneLake.

```bash
python upload_to_onelake.py
```

Make sure to configure the following in the script or via environment variables:

- Storage account URL (e.g., `https://onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com`)
- File system name (e.g., workspace name)
- Destination file path

---

### 3. `get_file_size_onelake.py` ‚Äì Retrieve File Size on OneLake

Retrieves and prints the file size (in bytes) of a specific file stored in OneLake.

```bash
python get_file_size_onelake.py
```

Example output:

```
‚úÖ File size: 12345 bytes
```

---

### 4. `preview_onelake_file.py` ‚Äì Preview File Contents

Downloads a file from OneLake and prints the first few lines of its content.

```bash
python preview_onelake_file.py
```

Example output:

```
‚úÖ File size: 1024 bytes
vendorid,lpep_pickup_datetime,...
1,2022-12-01 08:15:00,...
2,2022-12-01 09:00:00,...
```
